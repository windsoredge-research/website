        <p>Our goal is always to provide a full and bespoke service for our clients. With the analytical framework we

    <h3>Foundation Studies</h3>
    <p>If you are looking to strike oil, you need to survey the land before you start drilling. 
Foundation studies establish a broad, fundamental understanding of the market landscape, covering 
consumer opinions, needs, behaviour and buying decisions

    <h3>NPD Research</h3>
    <p>Do you already have a product and want to gauge the market readiness? Our New Product Development (NPD) 
research approach allows you to establish the interest and demand, define and refine the product or service 
itself, and determine the optimum proposition and position

    <span class="icon solid style2 major fa-chart-line"></span>
    <h3>Customer sentiment &amp; tracking</h3>
    <p>It is always important to understand what your customers think and feel about your brand, products,
and communications. How satisfied are they? What delights them? What are the things they want to see 
you improve on, and what risks driving them away?

    <span class="icon solid style2 major fa-tag"></span>
    <h3>Pricing research</h3>
    <p>What is your product or service worth? Pricing research is a unique area of insight. Price your product 
too low and profits walk out the door, too high and you don&#39;t get the sales. But there is always a sweet 
spot, and finding that Goldilocks &#34;just right&#34; level is the key to remaining competitive and profitable.
We use a number of statistical approaches and techniques, including the Gabor-Granger method and the van 
Westendorp price sensitivity metric, to find you that optimal pricing solution

    <h3>Segmentation</h3>
    <p>It is important to understand the different consumer groups or typologies within
your market and how they differ meaningfully in their needs, priorities, and behaviours. These
different groups are looking for different things from your product, brand or services, so understanding
where they&#39;re coming from and how to meet those needs can be critical to success. We use a 
variety of segmentation tools, all within-house, to identify, explain and illustrate the key segments for your
brand, including Max-Diff, conjoint and cluster analysis

                <section>
    <span class="icon solid style2 major fa-users"></span>
    <h3>Brand &amp; Comms</h3>
    <p>It is critical to understand how your brand communications are working to reach your customers and potential 
market audiences to positively impact and build robust relationships. 
Our specialist expertise in brand and communications tracking and evaluation doesn&#39;t use any black-box 
approaches that separate communication targets from their real-world impact; we start by establishing what 
you want your communications to achieve, then use that as the basis for our ongoing survey design.

        <h2>Panel companies</h2>
        <p>Panel companies have different specialisms, provenance and focus, 
and there is no one panel that is optimal for all research audiences. We work with three
different panel companies on a regular basis, so we know them and we know their strengths,
and these three are an excellent fit for our current clients. But we are open to working with
others if we perceive another panel is a better fit for a client project and sample 
requirement. This approach allows us to select the very best panel partner to meet your 
research and sample needs
