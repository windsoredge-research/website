  - name : "Customer sentiment & tracking"
    content : |
      It is always important to understand what your customers think and feel about your brand, products,
      and communications. How satisfied are they? What delights them? What are the things they want to see 
      you improve on, and what risks driving them away?

  - name : "Pricing research"
    content : |
      What is your product or service worth? Pricing research is a unique area of insight. Price your product 
      too low and profits walk out the door, too high and you don't get the sales. But there is always a sweet 
      spot, and finding that Goldilocks "just right" level is the key to remaining competitive and profitable.
      We use a number of statistical approaches and techniques, including the Gabor-Granger method and the van 
      Westendorp price sensitivity metric, to find you that optimal pricing solution

  - name : "Segmentation"
    content : |
      It is important to understand the different consumer groups or typologies within
      your market and how they differ meaningfully in their needs, priorities, and behaviours. These
      different groups are looking for different things from your product, brand or services, so understanding
      where they're coming from and how to meet those needs can be critical to success. We use a 
      variety of segmentation tools, all within-house, to identify, explain and illustrate the key segments for your
      brand, including Max-Diff, conjoint and cluster analysis

      It is critical to understand how your brand communications are working to reach your customers and potential 
      market audiences to positively impact and build robust relationships. 
      Our specialist expertise in brand and communications tracking and evaluation doesn't use any black-box 
      approaches that separate communication targets from their real-world impact; we start by establishing what 
      you want your communications to achieve, then use that as the basis for our ongoing survey design.
