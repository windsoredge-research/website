      Juliet is delighted to be a founding member of the Insight Leaders collective. Through Insight 
      Leaders, Windsoredge Research has access to some of the UK's most talented and experienced 
      independent consultants, not just in qualitative research but also many other behavioural and 
      strategy disciplines. So small does not mean fewer resources; we are able to take on bigger, 
      multi-faceted projects, with fully integrated, multi-discipline teams, to deliver fully integrated 
      findings and insights. <a href="https://insightleaders.com">Insight Leaders website</a>

      In 2020, we began working with the Displayr platform for survey analysis and advanced analytics. 
      Displayr is a powerful, one-stop platform that allows full connectivity of our data systems, 
      analysis, visualisations, reporting and dashboards. With Displayr, Windsoredge Research are able to 
      provide in-house advanced statistical techniques - such as max-diff, conjoint and turf analysis, to 
      name a few - without the usual hefty price tag. Juliet says, <em>"Displayr 
      is the integrated analysis and reporting package I've been looking for for 30 years. It has 
      completely revolutionised our analysis speed and power, taking our reporting and insight delivery to 
      new heights."</em> <a href="https://displayr.com">Displayr website</a>

  - title: "Panel companies"

      Panel companies have different specialisms, provenance and focus, 
      and there is no one panel that is optimal for all research audiences. We work with three
      different panel companies on a regular basis, so we know them and we know their strengths,
      and these three are an excellent fit for our current clients. But we are open to working with
      others if we perceive another panel is a better fit for a client project and sample 
      requirement. This approach allows us to select the very best panel partner to meet your 
      research and sample needs
